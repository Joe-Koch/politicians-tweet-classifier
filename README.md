# Classifying Politicians' Social Media Posts

An example of a text-based classification problem.

Can AI distinguish between biased and nonbiased tweets? Using a Kaggle dataset of 5000 social media posts written by American politicians, which have then been manually classified into categories which show what the message was intended to convey, as well as the certainty in each of those judgements. This project uses decision trees, naive Bayes classification, and logistic regression, among others, to classify these social media posts.
